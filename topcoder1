/* A substring of a string is a contiguous sequence of characters from
the string.  For example, each of the strings "ab", "bcd", and "e" is
a substring of "abcde". On the other hand, "cba", "ace", and "f" are
not substrings of "abcde".

The score of a string S is the number of ways in which we can select a
non-empty substring of S such that all characters in the substring are
the same.  If two substrings consist of the same letters but occur at
different places in S, they are still considered different.   For
example, the score of "aaaba" is 8: there are four occurrences of the
substring "a", two occurrences of "aa", one occurrence of "aaa", and
one of "b". */
